Monthly Density of Rejects from Sieving
***************************************

Data for the monthly density of rejects from sieving is captured by measuring
the filled and empty weights of rejects collected from sieving using the
standard box (whose volume is p[redefined within the municipality's profile)
and getting the difference to determine the net weight.

Using the box's volume and the net weight, a density value is calculated. This
volume is used as teh approximate volume for the month when calculating the
weight/tonnage of rejects landfilled within the
