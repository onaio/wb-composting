Daily Outgoing Compost Sales Register
*************************************

This register contains records from each compost sale. The weight of the compost
is either entered directly (if the compost was bagged) or calculated from the
volume of the compost and the month's density from the
:ref:`monthly_compost_density_register`

The distance travelled by the vehicle transporting the compost is also recorded
and used within the site's monthly report.
