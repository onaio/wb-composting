Daily Waste Register
********************

The daily waste register contains daily records on all trucks that come into
the compost site. The tonnage for each record is calculated from the volume and
the month's waste density. See :ref:`register_monthly_waste_density`

When the record cannot be approved
==================================

* If the skip type specified within the record does not exist in the
  municipality, the record cannot be approved. An exclamation will be displayed
  next to the skip type to indicate this. This can be resolved by either creating
  the skip within the municipality (see :ref:`creating_a_skip`)

* If the month's waste density cannot be determined, which is the case when you
  don't have 5 **approved** monthly waste density records for the particular
  month. This can be resolved my approving the monthly waste density records for
  that particular month.
