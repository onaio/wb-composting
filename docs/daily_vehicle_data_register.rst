Daily Vehicle Data Register
***************************

This register is used to record data on the use of the site's wee loader.
Everytime the wee loader is used within the site e.g. (to turn windrows) the
mileage is recorded at the start and the end of the exercise to determine the
total mileage.

Everytime fuel is purchased at the site, the amount of fuel is also recorded and
used within the site's report.
