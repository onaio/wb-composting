************************************
Register of Daily Rejects Landfilled
************************************

The data within this register is recorded rejects from either sorting or
sieving is landfilled. The number of wheelbarrows from sorting and the number
of wheelbarrows from sieving is recorded.

The total volume from sieving is then calculated from the multiplying the
volume of the wheelbarrow (defined within the municipality's profile) with the
number of wheelbarrows from sieving.

When the record cannot be approved
==================================

* When the month's density from sieving cannot be determined, the daily rejects
  from sieving for that particular month cannot be approved. This will be
  indicated by an exclamation mark in the *Volume of rejects from Sieving*
  column. This can be resolved by approving the *Monthly Density of Rejects
  from Sieving* record for that month.
