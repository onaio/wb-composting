Monthly Compost Density Register
********************************

The monthly compost density register contains records captured by filling the
standard box with mature compost, measuring its weight and getting the net
weight between that and the empty box's weight. The compost's density is then
calculated from the net weight and the volume of the box (which is defined
within the municipality's site profile).

This density is then used to determine the weight of compost within the
register of :ref:`monthly_composition_of_rejects_from_sieving`
