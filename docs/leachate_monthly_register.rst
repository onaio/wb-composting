Leachete Monthly Register
*************************

This register contains records captured everytime the site's accumulated
leachate is used to enrich mature compost. Whenever the site wants to use the
leachate, the height of the leachate is measured. The leachate is then pumped
into mature compost and afterb 24 hours, the height of the leachate is measured
again to determine the difference. This difference is multiplied by the
cross-sectional area of the site's leachate tank (defined within the site's
profile) to determine the volume of leachate used.

The total sum of this volume is then used within the site's monthly report.
