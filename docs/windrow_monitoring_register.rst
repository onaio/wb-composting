Windrow Monitoring Register
***************************

This register contains records captured on every windrow monitoring exercise.
Ideally, each windrow is monitored 3 times a week for 4 weeks, after which it
should be mature.

Each windrow has a unique windrow number. To view all the monitoring records
for a particular windrow, click on the windrow's number.
